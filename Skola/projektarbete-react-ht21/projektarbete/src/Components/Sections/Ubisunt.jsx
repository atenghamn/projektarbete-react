                I spent the last fifteen years, photographing people and places. My work has been seen at exhibitions, in magazines, on posters, commercials, webpages and
                numerous other places. In all these years I often thaught about what gives me the right to tell their story and how do I justify doing so? I dont have any answer
                to that for now but the world suddenly dont need a another white male gaze. Maybe a first step to find an answer is to look back and reflect on what I've seen? 
                This is an effort in doing so.
