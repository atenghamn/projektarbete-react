                I spent the last fifteen years, photographing people and places. My work has been seen at exhibitions, in magazines, on posters, commercials, webpages and
                numerous other places. In all these years I often thaught about what gives me the right to tell their story and how do I justify doing so? How can my white male 
                middlesaged gaze see beyond what meets the eye? Maybe I have to start by describe what I see to be able to reflect upon the things that pass me bye. This is an 
                effort in that direction.
